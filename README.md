# Gridiron Madness

Gridiron Madness is an application based on my love for the NFL. I am a HUGE Oakland Raider fan
 and thought i would make a NFL theme based application to use API calls to GIPHY that 
 displays all the most popular GIF's of your favorite NFL team. To add to the madness you are 
 also able to search more sports teams or any other GIFS you would like. Click on the image to check it out.

## Getting Started

Click on any preset button to pull the most recent GIF's related to any NFL team or sunject 
of your choice. Enjoy.
